## **Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search**


Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, write code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

<br>

Make sure you have a column for date/time, city, state, country, shape, and comment at the very least.

<br>

Use a date form in your HTML document and write JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
